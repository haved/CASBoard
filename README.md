# CASBoard
CAS stands for "Computer Algebra System", and is software used for algebraically doing equations, derivatives, vector math and  among other things.
CASBoard aims to be stable and sensible, with good error messages and intuitive design.
It puts all input and output on a board, with lines connecting relations.
Included are some features for visualizing the results, such as basic graphing capabilities.

The program is written in Kotlin using JavaFX for GUI.

### Build
#### Dependencies
 - Java 11.0.2
 - Kotlin 1.3.21
 - OpenJFX 11.0.2

#### Compiling
I don't know how to get gradle or maven to work. Doing without:
Download the dependencies manually, or use what your IntelliJ already has.
Open the IntelliJ project, open Module Settings and specify JDK version and add OpenJFX as a library.
